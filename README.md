# Dupe_Finder
A bash script to find duplicate files

Usage:
  - Run the script as ./filesizes.sh directory_1 directory_2

Future plans:
  - Size tollerance alone can result in false positives, or false negatives. Need to consider other parameters
  - Needs to be optimized to improve running time
  - Complete the original goal of finding duplicate files under different names in the same directory
